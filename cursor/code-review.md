Changes should be clear and easy to review

reviewer should be able to easily access the exact story or bug being worked on from the URL in the commit

reviewer should be able to understand from the header and body of the commit what was changed

actual code change should be consistent with the description in the commit 

any non-trivial change should have some appropriate comment for later reference

new code should be covered by unit tests which should pass

CI/CD on github should pass before it is merged

if a bug is fixed there should be some logs or screenshots uploaded in jira

if the above criteria is not met or the change does not make sense to the reviewer the developer has to fix it before it can be reviewed again
