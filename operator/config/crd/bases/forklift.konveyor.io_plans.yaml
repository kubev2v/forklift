                  ConvertorLabels are labels that should be applied to the virt-v2v convertor pods.
                  The convertor pods run virt-v2v to convert VMware disks, install KVM guest agents and drivers,
                  and handle disk data migration for cold migrations from VMware to KubeVirt.
                  Note: System-managed labels (migration, plan, vmID, forklift.app) will override any user-defined
                  labels with the same keys to ensure proper system functionality.
                  See Pod Labels documentation for more details,

                  ConvertorNodeSelector constrains the scheduler to only schedule virt-v2v convertor pods on nodes

                  workloads that require high I/O performance or network access to source VMware infrastructure.

                  Note:
                    - If this option is enabled and migration succeeds then the pod will get deleted. However the VM could still not boot and the virt-v2v logs, with additional information, will be deleted alongside guest conversion pod.

                  When true and the migration fails after the target VM has been created, the controller
                  will delete the target VM (and related target-side resources) during failed-migration cleanup
                  and when the Plan is deleted. When false (default), the target VM is preserved to aid
                  troubleshooting. The source VM is never modified.

                  Note: If the Plan-level option is set to true, the VM-level option will be ignored.

                  EnableDescheduler controls whether to enable the descheduler for migrated VMs.
                  When enabled, the descheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/evict annotation is added to the VirtualMachine,
                  allowing the OpenShift descheduler to rebalance VM workloads across the cluster.
                  This is similar to VMware DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) functionality.
                  For VMware source VMs:
                    - If the source VM had DRS enabled in VMware, this will be automatically set to true
                    - Otherwise it will be set to false unless explicitly overridden in the Plan
                  For other source providers:
                    - Defaults to false unless explicitly set to true in the Plan

              installLegacyDrivers:
                description: |-
                  InstallLegacyDrivers determines whether to install legacy windows drivers in the VM.
                  The following Vm's are lack of SHA-2 support and need legacy drivers:
                  Windows XP (all)
                  Windows Server 2003
                  Windows Vista (all)
                  Windows Server 2008
                  Windows 7 (pre-SP1)
                  Windows Server 2008 R2
                  Behavior:
                  - If set to nil (unset), the system will automatically detect whether the VM requires legacy drivers
                    based on its guest OS type (using IsLegacyWindows).
                  - If set to true, legacy drivers will be installed unconditionally by setting the VIRTIO_WIN environment variable.
                  - If set to false, legacy drivers will be skipped, and the system will fall back to using the standard (SHA-2 signed) drivers.

                  When enabled, legacy drivers are exposed to the virt-v2v conversion process via the VIRTIO_WIN environment variable,
                  which points to the legacy ISO at /usr/local/virtio-win-legacy.iso.

                    - .NetworkName: If target network is multus, name of the Multus network attachment definition, empty otherwise.
                    - .NetworkNamespace: If target network is multus, namespace where the network attachment definition is located.
                    - .NetworkType: type of the network ("Multus" or "Pod")
                    - .NetworkIndex: sequential index of the network interface (0-based)
                  The template can be used to customize network interface names based on target network configuration.

                  PVCNameTemplateUseGenerateName indicates if the PVC name template should use generateName instead of name.
                  Setting this to false will use the name field of the PVCNameTemplate.
                  This is useful when using a template that generates a name without a suffix.
                  For example, if the template is "{{.VmName}}-disk-{{.DiskIndex}}", setting this to false will result in
                  the PVC name being "{{.VmName}}-disk-{{.DiskIndex}}", which may not be unique.
                  but will be more predictable.
                  **DANGER** When set to false, the generated PVC name may not be unique and may cause conflicts.

                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                            DeleteVmOnFailMigration controls whether the target VM created by this Plan is deleted when a migration fails.
                            When true and the migration fails after the target VM has been created, the controller
                            will delete the target VM (and related target-side resources) during failed-migration cleanup

                            troubleshooting. The source VM is never modified.

                            Note: If the Plan-level option is set to true, the VM-level option will be ignored.

                            NetworkNameTemplate is a template for generating network interface names in the target virtual machine.
                            It follows Go template syntax and has access to the following variables:
                              - .NetworkName: If target network is multus, name of the Multus network attachment definition, empty otherwise.
                              - .NetworkNamespace: If target network is multus, namespace where the network attachment definition is located.
                              - .NetworkType: type of the network ("Multus" or "Pod")
                              - .NetworkIndex: sequential index of the network interface (0-based)
                            The template can be used to customize network interface names based on target network configuration.
                            Note:
                              - This template will override at the plan level template
