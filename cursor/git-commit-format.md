Git commit message header should have the unique Jira identifier of the story or bug you are working on (example MTV-3111)

Ideally after the Jira identifier there could be a pipe character and brief description possibly matching the jira story (example MTV-3111 | Add validations for VDDK and RCM)

The commit needs to be signed

There should only be one commit. If you have more than one commit you need to rebase and squash and then sign the one commit with the -s flag

The commit should also have a URL to the story or bug on jira for reference
