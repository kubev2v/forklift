# :lock: **Important Notice**
Starting with the release of **Container Storage Modules v1.16.0**, this repository will no longer be maintained as an open source project. Future development will continue under a closed source model. This change reflects our commitment to delivering even greater value to our customers by enabling faster innovation and more deeply integrated features with the Dell storage portfolio.<br>
For existing customers using Dell’s Container Storage Modules, you will continue to receive:
* **Ongoing Support & Community Engagement**<br>
       You will continue to receive high-quality support through Dell Support and our community channels. Your experience of engaging with the Dell community remains unchanged.
* **Streamlined Deployment & Updates**<br>
        Deployment and update processes will remain consistent, ensuring a smooth and familiar experience.
* **Access to Documentation & Resources**<br>
       All documentation and related materials will remain publicly accessible, providing transparency and technical guidance.
* **Continued Access to Current Open Source Version**<br>
       The current open-source version will remain available under its existing license for those who rely on it.

Moving to a closed source model allows Dell’s development team to accelerate feature delivery and enhance integration across our Enterprise Kubernetes Storage solutions ultimately providing a more seamless and robust experience.<br>
We deeply appreciate the contributions of the open source community and remain committed to supporting our customers through this transition.<br>
