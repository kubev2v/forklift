                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.

                        NetworkNameTemplate is a template for generating network interface names in the target virtual machine.
                        It follows Go template syntax and has access to the following variables:
                          - .NetworkName: If target network is multus, name of the Multus network attachment definition, empty otherwise.
                          - .NetworkNamespace: If target network is multus, namespace where the network attachment definition is located.
                          - .NetworkType: type of the network ("Multus" or "Pod")
                          - .NetworkIndex: sequential index of the network interface (0-based)
                        The template can be used to customize network interface names based on target network configuration.
                        Note:
                          - This template will override at the plan level template
                          - If not specified on VM level and on Plan leverl, default naming conventions will be used

                        PVCNameTemplate is a template for generating PVC names for VM disks.
                        It follows Go template syntax and has access to the following variables:
                          - .VmName: name of the VM
                          - .PlanName: name of the migration plan
                          - .DiskIndex: initial volume index of the disk
                          - .WinDriveLetter: Windows drive letter (lowercase, if applicable, e.g. "c", requires guest agent)
                          - .RootDiskIndex: index of the root disk
                          - .Shared: true if the volume is shared by multiple VMs, false otherwise
                          - .FileName: name of the file in the source provider (VMware only, filename includes the .vmdk suffix)
                        Note:
                          This template overrides the plan level template.
                        Examples:
                          "{{.VmName}}-disk-{{.DiskIndex}}"
                          "{{if eq .DiskIndex .RootDiskIndex}}root{{else}}data{{end}}-{{.DiskIndex}}"
                          "{{if .Shared}}shared-{{end}}{{.VmName}}-{{.DiskIndex}}"

                        TargetName specifies a custom name for the VM in the target cluster.
                        If not provided, the original VM name will be used and automatically adjusted to meet k8s DNS1123 requirements.
                        If provided, this exact name will be used instead. The migration will fail if the name is not unique or already in use.

                        TargetPowerState specifies the desired power state of the target VM after migration.
                        - "on": Target VM will be powered on after migration
                        - "off": Target VM will be powered off after migration
                        - "auto" or nil (default): Target VM will match the source VM's power state

                        VolumeNameTemplate is a template for generating volume interface names in the target virtual machine.
                        It follows Go template syntax and has access to the following variables:
                          - .PVCName: name of the PVC mounted to the VM using this volume
                          - .VolumeIndex: sequential index of the volume interface (0-based)
                        Note:
                          - This template will override at the plan level template
                          - If not specified on VM level and on Plan leverl, default naming conventions will be used
                        Examples:
                          "disk-{{.VolumeIndex}}"
                          "pvc-{{.PVCName}}"
