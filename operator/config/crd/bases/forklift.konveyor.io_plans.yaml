                  DeleteGuestConversionPod determines if the guest conversion pod should be deleted after successful migration.
                  Note:
                    - If this option is enabled and migration succeeds then the pod will get deleted. However the VM could still not boot and the virt-v2v logs, with additional information, will be deleted alongside guest conversion pod.

                  DeleteVmOnFailMigration controls whether the target VM created by this Plan is deleted when a migration fails.
                  When true and the migration fails after the target VM has been created, the controller
                  will delete the target VM (and related target-side resources) during failed-migration cleanup
                  and when the Plan is deleted. When false (default), the target VM is preserved to aid
                  troubleshooting. The source VM is never modified.

                  Note: If the Plan-level option is set to true, the VM-level option will be ignored.

                  InstallLegacyDrivers determines whether to install legacy windows drivers in the VM.
                  The following Vm's are lack of SHA-2 support and need legacy drivers:
                  Windows XP (all)
                  Windows Server 2003
                  Windows Vista (all)
                  Windows Server 2008
                  Windows 7 (pre-SP1)
                  Windows Server 2008 R2
                  Behavior:
                  - If set to nil (unset), the system will automatically detect whether the VM requires legacy drivers
                    based on its guest OS type (using IsLegacyWindows).
                  - If set to true, legacy drivers will be installed unconditionally by setting the VIRTIO_WIN environment variable.
                  - If set to false, legacy drivers will be skipped, and the system will fall back to using the standard (SHA-2 signed) drivers.

                  When enabled, legacy drivers are exposed to the virt-v2v conversion process via the VIRTIO_WIN environment variable,
                  which points to the legacy ISO at /usr/local/virtio-win.iso.

                  NetworkNameTemplate is a template for generating network interface names in the target virtual machine.
                  It follows Go template syntax and has access to the following variables:
                    - .NetworkName: If target network is multus, name of the Multus network attachment definition, empty otherwise.
                    - .NetworkNamespace: If target network is multus, namespace where the network attachment definition is located.
                    - .NetworkType: type of the network ("Multus" or "Pod")
                    - .NetworkIndex: sequential index of the network interface (0-based)
                  The template can be used to customize network interface names based on target network configuration.
                  Note:
                    - This template can be overridden at the individual VM level
                    - If not specified on VM level and on Plan leverl, default naming conventions will be used

                description: |-
                  PVCNameTemplate is a template for generating PVC names for VM disks.
                  It follows Go template syntax and has access to the following variables:
                    - .VmName: name of the VM
                    - .PlanName: name of the migration plan
                    - .DiskIndex: initial volume index of the disk
                    - .WinDriveLetter: Windows drive letter (lowercase, if applicable, e.g. "c", requires guest agent)
                    - .RootDiskIndex: index of the root disk
                    - .Shared: true if the volume is shared by multiple VMs, false otherwise
                    - .FileName: name of the file in the source provider (VMware only, filename includes the .vmdk suffix)
                  Note:
                    This template can be overridden at the individual VM level.
                  Examples:
                    "{{.VmName}}-disk-{{.DiskIndex}}"
                    "{{if eq .DiskIndex .RootDiskIndex}}root{{else}}data{{end}}-{{.DiskIndex}}"
                    "{{if .Shared}}shared-{{end}}{{.VmName}}-{{.DiskIndex}}"
                type: string
              pvcNameTemplateUseGenerateName:
                default: true
                description: |-
                  PVCNameTemplateUseGenerateName indicates if the PVC name template should use generateName instead of name.
                  Setting this to false will use the name field of the PVCNameTemplate.
                  This is useful when using a template that generates a name without a suffix.
                  For example, if the template is "{{.VmName}}-disk-{{.DiskIndex}}", setting this to false will result in
                  the PVC name being "{{.VmName}}-disk-{{.DiskIndex}}", which may not be unique.
                  but will be more predictable.
                  **DANGER** When set to false, the generated PVC name may not be unique and may cause conflicts.

                            DeleteVmOnFailMigration controls whether the target VM created by this Plan is deleted when a migration fails.
                            When true and the migration fails after the target VM has been created, the controller
                            will delete the target VM (and related target-side resources) during failed-migration cleanup
                            and when the Plan is deleted. When false (default), the target VM is preserved to aid
                            troubleshooting. The source VM is never modified.

                            Note: If the Plan-level option is set to true, the VM-level option will be ignored.

                                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                      referencing a part of an object.

                                If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                referencing a part of an object.

                            NetworkNameTemplate is a template for generating network interface names in the target virtual machine.
                            It follows Go template syntax and has access to the following variables:
                              - .NetworkName: If target network is multus, name of the Multus network attachment definition, empty otherwise.
                              - .NetworkNamespace: If target network is multus, namespace where the network attachment definition is located.
                              - .NetworkType: type of the network ("Multus" or "Pod")
                              - .NetworkIndex: sequential index of the network interface (0-based)
                            The template can be used to customize network interface names based on target network configuration.
                            Note:
                              - This template will override at the plan level template
                              - If not specified on VM level and on Plan leverl, default naming conventions will be used
                            Examples:
                              "net-{{.NetworkIndex}}"

                            PVCNameTemplate is a template for generating PVC names for VM disks.
                            It follows Go template syntax and has access to the following variables:
                              - .VmName: name of the VM
                              - .PlanName: name of the migration plan
                              - .DiskIndex: initial volume index of the disk
                              - .WinDriveLetter: Windows drive letter (lowercase, if applicable, e.g. "c", requires guest agent)
                              - .RootDiskIndex: index of the root disk
                              - .Shared: true if the volume is shared by multiple VMs, false otherwise
                              - .FileName: name of the file in the source provider (VMware only, filename includes the .vmdk suffix)
                            Note:
                              This template overrides the plan level template.
                            Examples:
                              "{{.VmName}}-disk-{{.DiskIndex}}"
