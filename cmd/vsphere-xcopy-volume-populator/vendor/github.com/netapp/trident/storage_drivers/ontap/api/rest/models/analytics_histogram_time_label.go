// AnalyticsHistogramTimeLabel Each label indicates the period of time the corresponding data is associated with. A label can take one of the following forms:<ul>
// <li>a partial date in an extended ISO8601 representation</li>
// <li>an interval between partial dates in an extended ISO8601 representation, where "<span>-</span>-" is used to separate the beginning and end of the interval</li>
// <li>the string literal <span>"</span>unknown"</li>
// </ul>For partial dates and partial date intervals where components of a date are unspecified, the label allows for any valid normalized values the unspecified components might take. For example, the label "2017" allows for any time within the year 2017. Essentially, this is the fully specified interval 2017-01-01T00:00:00<span>-</span>-2017-12-31T23:59:59. Similarly, the interval "2018-05<span>-</span>-2018-07" allows for any time within the months of May, June, and July in 2018, corresponding to the fully specified interval 2018-05-01T00:00:00<span>-</span>-2018-07-31T23:59:59. <br/><br/>
// The following extensions to ISO8601 are used:<ul>
// <li>Quarters may be specified. The form <i>yyyy</i>-Q<i>q</i> is used to represent the <i>q</i>th quarter of the year <i>yyyy</i>. Q1 consists of the months January, February, and March; Q2 consists of April, May, and June; Q3 consists of July, August, and September; Q4 consists of October, November, and December. For example, the label "2019-Q2" represents the second quarter of the year 2019, which corresponds to the interval 2019-04-01T00:00:00--2019-06-30T23:59:59.</li>
// <li>Either the beginning or end of an interval may be omitted. When the beginning is omitted, the interval includes points in time arbitrarily far in the past. When the end is omitted, the interval includes points in time through the end of the current week.</li>
// </ul>The <span>"</span>unknown" label tracks data that could not be associated with any other time period. This usually occurs when the data was at some point associated with a time in the future.
